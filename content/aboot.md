In the past, I've worked on research projects ranging from environmental regulation in California to agricultural policy in Sub-Saharan Africa. From 2018-2019, I was a Junior Project Associate at the 
[University of Chicago Energy & Environment Lab](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/energy-environment), a joint effort of [Urban Labs](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/) and the [Energy Policy Institute of Chicago (EPIC)](https://epic.uchicago.edu/). We use machine learning and randomized trials to evaluate and inform policy on greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and hazardous waste management. 

In the summer of 2018, I was a Wilmers Research Fellow and research assistant for Professor Susan Godlonton in Cape Town, South Africa, conducting follow-up econometric analysis on agricultural and public health research projects in Malawi.

I'm from Vancouver, Canada and Guangzhou, China -- talk to me in English, Cantonese, or Mandarin!
