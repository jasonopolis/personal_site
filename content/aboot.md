Hey! My name is J.S. (Jason) Liu, and I'm an environmental/development economics and computer science student at Williams College, expected to graduate in 2021. My pronouns are [they/them](//my.pronoun.is/they) but he/him are okay too.

I'm interested in applying data science, economics, and public policy research to solving societal problems, from climate change to discrimination to global poverty and inequality. In the past, I've worked on research projects ranging from environmental regulation in California to agricultural policy in Sub-Saharan Africa.  

I'm currently looking for opportunities as a pre-doctoral economics research assistant, or entry-level positions in data science and engineering. Please feel free to reach out!

For a little bit more about my past experience, from 2018-2019, I was a Junior Project Associate at the 
[University of Chicago Energy & Environment Lab](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/energy-environment), a joint effort of [Urban Labs](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/) and the [Energy Policy Institute of Chicago (EPIC)](https://epic.uchicago.edu/). We use machine learning and randomized trials to evaluate and inform policy on greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and hazardous waste management. 

In the summer of 2018, I was a Wilmers Research Fellow and research assistant for Professor Susan Godlonton in Cape Town, South Africa, conducting follow-up econometric analysis on agricultural and public health research projects in Malawi.

I'm from Vancouver, Canada and Guangzhou, China -- talk to me in English, Cantonese, or Mandarin!
