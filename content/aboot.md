Hey! My name is J.S. (Jason) Liu, and I'm an environmental and development 
economics student and researcher from Vancouver, Canada and Guangzhou, China.

I'm currently a Junior Project Associate at the 
[University of Chicago Energy & Environment Lab](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/energy-environment), a joint effort of [Urban Labs](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/) and the [Energy Policy Institute of Chicago (EPIC)](https://epic.uchicago.edu/). We use machine learning and randomized trials to evaluate and inform policy on greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and hazardous waste management. In particular, I've worked closely with the California Air Resources Board (part of the California EPA) in Sacramento, CA, USA. Previously, I was a Wilmers Research Fellow for Professor Susan Godlonton in Cape Town, South Africa, working on agricultural and public health projects in Malawi.

In Fall 2020, I'll be returning (possibly remotely!) to study Economics and 
Computer Science at Williams College, MA. 

I go by they/them pronouns (he/him are okay too)!
