Hey! My name is J.S. (Jason) Liu, and I'm an environmental and development 
economics student and researcher. 

Currently, I work as a Junior Project Associate at the 
[University of Chicago Energy & Environment Lab](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/energy-environment), 
a joint effort of [ Urban Labs](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/) 
and the [Energy Policy Institute of Chicago (EPIC)](https://epic.uchicago.edu/). 
I mostly work on research projects applying predictive analytics and randomized 
evaluation to inform policy on greenhouse gas emissions, PM air pollution, and 
hazardous waste management. In particular, I've worked closely with the 
California Air Resources Board in Sacramento, CA. 

Previously, I was a Wilmers Research Fellow for Professor Susan Godlonton in 
Cape Town, South Africa.

I'm currently studying Economics and Computer Science at Williams College. 

I go by they/them pronouns (he/him are okay too!).
